# SegSoft Assignment 2

## Installation Instructions

This project uses [Maven][1] so you can use your IDE of choice and import this repository directly as a maven project or
clone it and run if you have maven installed (all required libraries are downloaded and configured by the pom.xml file).

## Running Instructions

After starting the program you will be presented with a Setup webpage, where you need to create the root user.
To do that, just insert your desired password and click 'Submit'.

**Note**: Passwords must be strings composed of at least 8 to 64 characters.

Next you need to Login using the root user credentials, and you will get access to the home page, showing all available operations.
Now you're ready to explore and use the system as you desire.

**Note**: Usernames must be strings composed of at least 2 to 16 **lowercase** characters.

**Observation**: Both the *advanced* extra requirements were implemented in our project (data privacy level definition and friend requests).
